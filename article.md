What I've learnt in 1 month of programming

### 1. Getting started from scratch
Well, less than a month ago, I had no clue about coding languages, programming, or coding itself. Sure, I had a vague idea that it's a profession and many people work in it, but for me, it was literally: "Developers: how do they eat? Where do they work? What's their natural habitat? Do they really exist?" ROFL.

It was after attending my first tech event, **Frontin Sampa**, that I decided: "I'm going to start studying programming and **change my career**," I've even shared more details in this [article](https://dev.to/acamikuro/-uma-produtora-de-tv-no-mundo-dev-44p3)(which is in portuguese).

So, I began my studies with a [**simple roadmap**]([https://trilha.info/roadmap/frontend](https://trilha.info/roadmap/frontend)) that helped me a lot in **getting started**, and the best part is that it includes some **free resources** you can pick as you learn!

In addition to learning the basics of **front-end** programming, I dedicated myself to understanding the concept of **open source**, which was one of the talks I watched in the tech event and was completely amazed by.

Another crucial point, that is helping me with the initial steps, is my active participation in a tech community. Today, I'm part of [He4rt Developers](https://discord.gg/he4rt), an active, engaged, and collaborative community. Inside there, we have **discussions** on important topics, **project collaborations**, weekly meetings, and free projects for beginners in the field.

That's not all. From the second week of my studies, I began to be mentored and explore more complex topics (though for those who already know, it's quite easy to understand, right?). Front-end is amazing; I understood everything! But when I got to the back-end... oh, omg. I had never seen so much code all at once.

Moreover, what has encouraged me to study every day is the ["100 Days of Code"](https://www.100diasdecodigo.dev/#comoParticipar) challenge, created by the He4rt Devs community. With this, I could post every day what I study and my learning evolution.

In the mentoring sessions, I learned about concepts like HTTP, Linux, the difference between Git and GitHub, and briefly about database modeling. It might seem like a lot of concepts for such a short learning period. I managed to learn the basics to start my journey, and now I'll explain each of them!

### 2. Concepts learned so far

#### 1. Open source
I began my studies by researching the concept of **"open source,"** which is a **software licensing model** that allows access to the source code by anyone. In other words, anyone can explore, modify, contribute, and distribute the code according to the specific terms of its license.

At that point, I thought, "Okay, I get the concept, but I need some examples." So, I continued my research and learned more about the Linux operating system, which is open source. We'll talk about it later. Another example is companies, including tech giants, that also contribute to open source projects and use **open source software** in their operations.

Working with open source can offer numerous benefits, such as transparency, collaboration, and the formation of engaging communities that collectively work on the same project openly.

#### 2. Basics: HTML, CSS and JS
The next topic of study was starting with the basics of programming, like the famous "hello world." Thanks to the roadmap, it was easy to know where to begin. I began my HTML studies with a comprehensive online course, where I first learned the terminology used for coding, the codes themselves, and how to use them correctly in a command to get the desired outcome. HTML is what structures the foundation of a web site. HTML uses "tags" to mark elements like headings, paragraphs, and images, instructing the browser on how to display them on the page.

Next, I learned CSS, which was one of my favorite parts of the study. Having the ability to change EVERYTHING you see on a web site is surreal to imagine, and with each lesson, as I learned something new, I tried to visualize if it made sense and if it worked (and it does, wow). CSS is responsible for the appearance and style of HTML content. With it, you can change colors, font sizes, spacing, and even the position of elements on the page, making everything look beautiful and organized.

Then came JavaScript, and I thought I had seen many "cool" codes before, but I was even more enchanted with this one because it's what makes the web site interactive. It allows you to create buttons that do something when you click on them, update parts of the page without reloading the entire page, and much more.

#### 3. Documenting my journey
Basically, while I was taking the HTML course, I also started online mentoring sessions on other subjects. During these mentorships, I learned to take notes in bullet list as I went along, making it much easier to refer back to later when needed. I also learned how to make notes in markdown and understood where the "md" at the end of files like "README.md" came from. Another point to add is that most of the mentorships were conducted in English, which helped me improve my technical vocabulary as well as my conversation skills.

#### 4. Git and GitHub
In this mentorship, we began by exploring the difference between Git and GitHub, as well as the terminologies associated with both:

```
* Git
	* Tool for versioning your codebase
	* Terminology:
		* Repository (project) - getting-started
			* Branches (environments inside a project)
				* Commits - (changes into the codebase)
* GitHub
	* (Cloud Environment) Host the repository
	* Issues - Place to discuss bug, glitch, improvements, fixes, ideas or w/e
	* Pull Request - Submit changes into the codebase (in different branch/fork)
* Setup my GitHub account
	* create a READ.md 
	* add commits 
```

**"Git"** is an essential tool to version control that allows to developers collaborate effectively on projects. **"GitHub** is a platform that hosts Git repositories and facilitates teamwork. Learned to use this tools given me the ability to contribute on projects open source and share my own code with the community. 

#### 5. Linux Basics
The next topic studied in mentoring was Linux operational system which is open source, meaning source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify and distribute. With this, the large community of developers and enthusiasts can contribute to its development and create their own version around the Linux kernel. Some popular distributes Linux include Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat and CentOS.

Just like the other mentorships, my notes look like this:
```
* Linux 101
	* Distributions
		* Kernel, Package Manager, Drivers, Tools/Tooling and Shell
		* Graphic Environment: 
			* Gnome (Ubuntu)
			* Kubuntu (KDE)
			* OS X (Plasma)
			* Link to [UnixPorn] (https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn)
```

After explaining the theoretical part, I went to practice. Using the command **"cat .bashrc"** was it possible for me to see all existent commands. So I decided to create one more command and for that, I access **"nano .bashrc"** and done.

#### 6. HTTP Protocol
To conclude the concepts learned, I'll explain about **HTTP**, that is an acronym to Hypertext Transfer Protocol being a **connection** between the **client and server**. The cliente can be the browser, mobile or anything that runs HTTP. While the server can be any web site where a request is sent and a response is received.  

As soon as we request datas or services to server, it can reply to the client some **status** which are represented for numbers, I think the best-known of all is the **"404"** which returns a **"not found"** message. But has other HTTP statuses like **"201 - Created"** and **"500 - Internal Server Error".**

To illustrate these statuses better, during the mentorship I was given a website that shows all of them with [kitten memes](https://http.cat/) and a brief description. I thought it sensational and helped me to fix better each one of statuses.

HTTP also uses **verbs** like **"GET"** to get information and **"POST"** to send or publish data to a server. Also, it can work with JSON, a document model usually used to analyze and transform data, making it a fundamental protocol for all our online activities. 

### 3. Conclusion
During one month in daily contact with code, concepts and activities, I feel I've evolved from a person completely devoid of knowledge in the area to someone who has a certain notion, and honestly? I'm very happy to be able to learn the basics and can show you everything in this article.

One of the next steps is definitely, improving the practical and technical side (coding) and maybe even apply for a job in the area, as the career transition is already real.
